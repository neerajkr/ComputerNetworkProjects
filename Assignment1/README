---------------------------------------

Files:
1. server.cpp
2. client.cpp
3. Makefile

------------------------
File Description:

1. server.cpp is coded in c++ language which is for server side of communication
2. client.cpp is for client side
3. Makefile is to compile both files together

-------------------------------------------------
Steps to run the program:

1. For compiling the server.cpp and client.cpp, type make on command line. It will compile both the files
2. Then, run server by typing ./server port e.g. ./server 65000 on command line
3. open a new terminal and run client by typing ./client localhost port e.g. ./client localhost 65000
4. A welcome msg will come and will ask for file name to open.
5. Type the file name. If file name is valid then it will print the content on terminal window.
6. If file name is invalid then, it will write- no such file exists & for empty file it will again show a msg saying file is empty
7. After the first file, client will again ask for file name and again will do the same.
8. If you cut the client terminal, and again open with same port, it will again connected with server and will do the same as above
9. Both client and server is running in infinite loop as given in the assignment
10. checked with two system as well, was running fine

Note: Server also shows the filename which i want
